# Priority Fixes

The following issues have been identified and require immediate attention. Prioritize addressing these issues before working on new features.

## Frontend/Styling Fixes

### 1. Homepage Header White Bar
When refreshing the homepage, a white bar appears briefly in the header area. 
- Check `assets/css/main.css` for header styles
- Review `assets/js/animations.js` and `assets/js/navigation.js` for transition issues
- Examine `header.php` for structural problems

### 2. Shop Categories Button Icons
The Shop Categories section buttons should not display icons, and text should be centered.
- Fix `template-parts/homepage/shop-categories.php`
- Update styles in `assets/css/shop-categories.css` or `assets/css/main.css`

### 3. Homepage Section Indicators
Custom section indicators display generic text ("Section 1", "Section 2") instead of meaningful labels.
- Update in `inc/customizer.php` if set via Customizer
- Check `template-parts/homepage/*` if hardcoded
- Review `assets/js/split-slideshow.js` or `assets/js/animations.js` if generated dynamically

### 4. WooCommerce Review Section Styling
The reviews section/tab on single product pages lacks proper styling.
- Update styles in `assets/css/product-page.css` or `assets/css/main.css`
- Check overridden template `woocommerce/single-product/tabs/reviews.php` if present

### 5. Single Product Page Spacing
Adjust element spacing on single product pages for better visual flow.
- Fix in `assets/css/product-page.css` or `assets/css/main.css`
- Check templates `woocommerce/single-product.php` and `woocommerce/content-single-product.php`

### 6. Navigation Bar Size/Spacing
The main navigation bar needs to be vertically smaller with better text link spacing.
- Update styles in `header.php` and `assets/css/main.css`
- Check any scripts in `assets/js/navigation.js`

## PHP Warnings

### WooCommerce Product Gallery Warnings
PHP warnings appear on single product pages related to gallery functions.
- Check `inc/woocommerce.php` for hooks modifying the gallery
- Review `functions.php` for image size registration/theme support
- Examine gallery template structure in product templates
