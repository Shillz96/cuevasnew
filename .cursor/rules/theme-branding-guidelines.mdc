# Theme Branding Guidelines

The Cuevas Western Wear theme must maintain consistent branding elements throughout all template files and styles to create a cohesive western-inspired design.

## Color Palette
Always use the official brand colors defined as CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --color-background: #F5F5DC; /* Beige */
  --color-text: #3E2723; /* Dark Brown */
  --color-accent: #8B4513; /* Saddle Brown */
  --color-buttons: #A52A2A; /* Brown Red */
  --color-secondary: #D2691E; /* Chocolate */
}
```

Do not use hardcoded color values. Always reference these CSS variables.

## Typography
Maintain the brand typography hierarchy:
- Global font: Cinzel (primary font throughout the theme)
- Headings: Cinzel 
- Body text: Cinzel for main content
- Accent text: Cinzel for emphasis and special sections

## Animation Guidelines
- Use GSAP for all animations
- Keep animations subtle and enhance the user experience
- Ensure animations are optimized for performance
- Provide reduced motion alternatives

## Layout
- Implement full-width layouts for immersive browsing
- Use a responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Ensure the hamburger menu works consistently across devices
